### Just my attempt to learn the Erlang language
------

In case someone wants to figure it out and start at home, then go through these steps :

1. Install erlang in your machine [Click this instruction](https://medium.com/erlang-central/erlang-quick-install-9c5dcaa5b634).

2. Enter into erl: write in your console `erl`.

3. Compile main.erl file: `c(main).`

4. `Users = main:get_users().`

5. Done now you can use functions where user list is used 

    For example: 

    `
    main:split_by_age(Users).
    `
6. Come again!
